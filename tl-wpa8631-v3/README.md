This is a report on the partition layouts of all TP-Link TL-WPA8631P Ver 3.0 firmwares, current as of 2021-02-19.
This information will be used to add support in OpenWRT for this model.

The overall finding is that compared to the WPA8630Pv2, thankfully all known region variants currently use the same partition layout.

There are 2 earlier different EU layouts, but the latest 2 EU layouts match with US and AU. So long as the user upgrades from those before continuing, flashing and reverting-to-stock will work smoothly.
